# nginx-obs-automatic-low-bitrate-switching
Simple app to automatically switch scenes in OBS Studio/OBS.Live based on the current bitrate fetched from the server stats.

---
NOALBS is used as a DIY tool to have your OBS Studio/OBS.Live auto switch scenes when you are either in a LOW bitrate situation or if your source disconnects completely.

## Upsides to using NOALBS:
- You did it yourself so be proud of what you have accomplished.
- You're using a computer, internet and power you are already paying for.
- There is literally NO COST to you when you setup and use NOALBS using the equipment you already own and pay for.

## Downsides to using NOALBS:
- It's DIY, meaning you have to do it all yourself, of course you can always contact us on discord @ b3ck#3517 or 715209#0600 and we'll do our best to help out.
- If you lose power or internet where you run NOALBS there is no redundancy.
- It takes a bit to setup, it is not for the faint of heart when it comes to installing and configuring advanced programs to get it running.

(Watch video below for help)

If you're okay with all of that then all I can say is if you can't figure it out, reach out to us or the community if you need help, we're here for you.

## Installation from Source and NGINX Setup

-   `git clone <repository-url>` or download from [RELEASES](https://github.com/715209/nginx-obs-automatic-low-bitrate-switching/releases)
-   Change into the new directory.
-   `npm install --production`

If you already have NGINX-RTMP server
-   Replace your `nginx.conf` with the one given here.
-   Put `stat.xsl` in your nginx `html` folder.

Otherwise here is a Windows version of NGINX+RTMP Server
- [Hosted on Github](https://github.com/715209/nginx-obs-automatic-low-bitrate-switching/raw/master/nginx/nginx_1.7.11.3_Gryphon_With_NOALBS.config_files_03162020.zip)
- Everything is ready to go inside this zip, just extract and click on the `nginx_start.bat` file to start NGINX, you can use `nginx_stop.bat` to stop NGINX. HTTP server runs on Port `80`, RTMP server runs on `1935`, if you need to edit the config file it's in the `/conf` folder, named `nginx.conf`.

## Configuring the CONFIG and Setting up Roles

Edit `config.json` to your own settings.

Here is an example config with comments (click to enlarge):

**_PLEASE NOTE CONFIG ARCHITECTURE MAY NOT REPRESENT CURRENT CONFIG ARCHITECTURE_**

![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/cVbz1bN.png "Configuration Comments (Click to Enlarge)")

-   Use https://twitchapps.com/tmi to get your oauth from Twitch for use with chat commands.
    > We recommend using your main Twitch BOT account for this, but if you do not have a Twitch Bot account just use your Main Twitch Account.

Also if you are going to be using your Twitch BOT Account please make sure it is an 'Editor' of your channel, see example;

Go to this URL: [Twitch User Roles](https://www.twitch.tv/dashboard/roles/), Find your bot on the list, add checkmark to 'Editor', done.

## Chat Commands

This script gives you the option to enable some simple chat commands to help you manage your stream from your own Twitch chat, here is how to use them:

> Please note: Admins are all the users in the "adminUsers" array in the config, MODs (if enabled in the config) are all of your MODs, and Public (if enabled in the config) is anyone in your chat.

> | Default Role | Command                               | Description                                                                                             | Example              |

## How to publish to your NGINX RTMP Server:

Using the default config where the server is listening on port `1935` and the name of the application in NGINX is `publish`;

<sub>_(example config, do not copy)_</sub>
```NGINX
rtmp {

    server {
        listen 1935;
        (...)
        
        # Stream to "rtmp://IPHERE/publish/live".
        application publish {
            live on;
            (...)
        }
    }
}
```

- If the app or device requires the key separately put `rtmp://(SERVER-IP):1935/publish` in the RTMP URL and `live` in the key.
- Otherwise if the app or device doesn't require the key separately put `rtmp://(SERVER-IP):1935/publish/live` in the RTMP URL.

Most of these rules apply to the rest of the other types of servers;
- RTMP will usually have an `application` and a `key`.
- SRT will use a `publisher` ID or `streamid`, some applications or devices will only require your server IP and PORT;
    - Example; `srt://(SERVER-IP):30000` but if it the app or device supports `streamid` it will always be separate.

Either way, pay close attention to your app or device requirements, as you will need to setup accordingly to them and your configuration on the server.

## How to pull RTMP stream into OBS

Update your OBS to v26+ and follow the steps below:

1.) In OBS create the following scenes:
- `LIVE`, `LOW`, `BRB`, `REFRESH`
 - I highly recommend creating a `STARTUP` & `PRIVACY` scene, the `STARTUP` scene can contain whatever you want to start your stream on and then switch to `LIVE` when you're ready, the `PRIVACY` scene can be whatever you want to put the stream on when you need privacy, the main thing is that it's out of NOALBS scope and won't automatically switch scenes.
- The normal flow is to have your OBS on `STARTUP` when you start stream and when you're ready either you or an instructed MOD can !switch LIVE, when you need privacy use !switch PRIVACY.

2.) In your `LIVE` scene, add a 'Media Source', match the image below:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1740542/113238763-05b97f00-926f-11eb-86d2-d9aabf94bf08.png)
  - Right click on the 'Media Source' > Transform > Stretch to screen (this will stretch the video source no matter the resolution, ex; 480p, 720p, 1080p etc.)

3.) Copy and Paste(Reference) the 'Media Source' from the `LIVE` scene into your `LOW` scene.
  - Do the same transformation procedure from step (2).

4.) Go over all of your scenes and make them your own.

## Running with other servers (not NGINX):
### Using the built-in Node-Media-Server
Defining a `nodeMediaServer` block in config.json will enable a fully functional node-media-server RTMP server to accept incoming streams:

```JSON
    "rtmp": {
        "application": "publish",
        "key": "live"
    },
    "nodeMediaServer": {
        "rtmp": {
            "port": 1935,
            "chunk_size": 60000,
            "gop_cache": true,
            "ping": 30,
            "ping_timeout": 60
        },
        "http": {
            "port": 8000
        }
    },
```

> The `nodeMediaServer` object is passed directly as the node-media-server configuration, [more details here](https://github.com/illuspas/Node-Media-Server#npm-version-recommended). It will also automatically fill out the rtmp server type and stats fields.

> Note: This is probably best for local connections and testing only unless you [enable authentication](https://github.com/illuspas/Node-Media-Server#authentication)

<sub>_[(table of contents)](#table-of-contents)_</sub>

---
### Using an external Node-Media-Server
Modify the RTMP section in config.json like this to connect to a node-media-server running externally:

```JSON
    "rtmp": {
        "server": "node-media-server",
        "stats": "http://localhost:8000/api/streams",
        "application": "publish",
        "key": "live"
    },
```

<sub>_[(table of contents)](#table-of-contents)_</sub>

---
### Using Nimble Streamer Server (with SRT protocol)

Nimble must have [API access enabled](https://wmspanel.com/nimble/api) and be configured as a SRT receiver - see ["Set up receiving of SRT"](https://blog.wmspanel.com/2017/07/setup-srt-secure-reliable-transport-nimble-streamer.html) and have an outgoing stream ("Add outgoing stream" on same page)

Modify the RTMP section in config.json to this:

```JSON
    "rtmp": {
        "server": "nimble",
        "stats": "http://nimble:8082",
        "id": "0.0.0.0:1234",
        "application": "live",
        "key": "srt"
    },
```

- `stats`: URL to nimble API
- `id`: UDP listener ID (Usually IP:Port)
- `application`: Outgoing stream "Application Name"
- `key`: Outgoing stream "Stream Name"

>Switches on low bitrate or high RTT (high RTT seems to be a more accurate way of determining if the stream is bad with this)

You can change the high RTT trigger value inside config.json:

```JSON
    "obs": {
        ...
        "highRttTrigger": 2500,
    },
```

### Using SLS (SRT-LIVE-SERVER)
> Big Thanks to [oozebrood](https://www.twitch.tv/oozebrood), [matthewwb2](https://www.twitch.tv/matthewwb2), and [kyle___d](https://www.twitch.tv/kyle___d) for all of the hard work they've put into getting SRT to the masses!

If you're using either [Matt's modified version](https://gitlab.com/mattwb65/srt-live-server) or
[my edit of Matt's version](https://hub.docker.com/r/b3ckontwitch/sls-b3ck-edit) of SLS then follow this section;

You MUST Modify the ENTIRE RTMP section in NOALBS `config.json` file to match this:

(And yes we know calling this configuration block the 'RTMP section' is rather dumb at this point, but it is what it is until it is changed.)

```JSON
    "rtmp": {
        "server": "srt-live-server",
        "stats": "http://127.0.0.1:8181/stats",
        "publisher": "publish/live/feed1"
    },
```

- `server`: Type of streaming server. (ex; nginx, nms, nimble or srt-live-server )
- `stats`: URL to SLS stats page (ex; http://127.0.0.1:8181/stats )
- `publisher`: StreamID of the where you are publishing the feed. (ex; publish/live/feed1 )

    - Publisher, what is a publisher? it's a combination of `domain_publisher`/`app_publisher`/`<whatever-you-want>`.
    - So if your `domain_publisher` was "uplive.sls.com", and your `app_publisher` was "live", it would be `uplive.sls.com/live/<whatever-you-want>`.
    - You could literally call you domain_publisher 'billy', app_publisher 'bob', and then set your streamid (publisher) to 'billy/bob/thorton' if you wanted to.
    - Publisher is also what you entered in the config under `default_sid`.  Unless you are streaming to a different 'StreamID' of course, ex; `publish/live/tinkerbell`.


See Example Below from the `sls.conf` file in the SLS main directory:
    
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1740542/94368739-7955b600-00ab-11eb-9946-20b66f9f4fb2.png)

So in actuality your 'publisher' is your default `StreamID`, like in the example above it's `billy/bob/thorton`.

>Switches on low bitrate or high RTT (high RTT seems to be a more accurate way of determining if the stream is bad with this)

You can change the high RTT trigger value inside config.json:

```JSON
    "obs": {
        ...
        "highRttTrigger": 2500,
    },
```

====
How do I publish to the SLS Server? see [HERE](https://gitlab.com/mattwb65/srt-live-server#1test-with-ffmpeg)

How do I pull the SRT feed into OBS?

- Add Media Source
- Uncheck Local File
- In the "Input" field enter in: `srt://<SERVER-IP>:<PORT>/?streamid=<PUBLISHER>`
   - Using the example from the above image, it would be `srt://<SERVER-IP>:<PORT>/?streamid=jojo/bob/thorton`
- In the "Input Format" field enter in: `mpegts`
- Check `Seekable` then click `OK`

## Help it won't change scenes

It will only change scenes when OBS is set on a scene that's in the config.  
(This is so that it wont change when you are on for example your 'intro' or 'locked-brb' scene)
